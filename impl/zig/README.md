# Zig Core

The Zig Core is a third NorthTalk Core for embedding outside Go and TS: natively
through the C API in [`include/talk.h`](include/talk.h), and as a `wasm32-wasi`
module for Hosts with a WASM runtime
([ADR 0078](../../docs/adr/0078-the-zig-third-core-is-built-though-the-message-layer-meets-its-thresholds.md)).
It is written from the Spec, its Data Files and the Conformance Corpus, never
translated from the Go or TS Core
([ADR 0071](../../docs/adr/0071-a-third-core-serves-embedding-outside-go-and-ts-after-the-message-layer-is-measured.md),
[ADR 0009](../../docs/adr/0009-twin-cores-held-to-bit-for-bit-parity.md)). The
design decisions that bind it are recorded on
[#625](https://github.com/odogono/odgn-talk/issues/625#issuecomment-6111271797).

It is under construction, step by step through
[Appendix B](../../spec/appendix-b-implementation-order.md). So far it has its
generated tables, the Unicode text primitives and the Host's text constructor.

Use the [Zig task map](NAVIGATION.md) for implementation files, Spec links,
tests and check commands.

## Layout

- `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon`: one Zig package, `northtalk`, pinned to Zig
  0.17.0 by `minimum_zig_version`. It uses Zig's standard library only: no
  third-party packages and no linked C libraries.
- `include/talk.h`: the C API. It mirrors
  [`spec/embedding/talk.go`](../../spec/embedding/talk.go)'s names in C style,
  as [`tools/zig/api.ts`](../../tools/zig/api.ts) spells them, and declares only
  what the Core implements.
- `src/root.zig`: the package root. [`src/talk.zig`](src/talk.zig) holds
  `talk.h`'s exports.
- `src/unicode/`: UTF-8, NFC, Characters (extended grapheme clusters), simple
  case folding, and the `word` and `word break` rules, built only on the
  generated tables.
- `src/generated/`: tables written from the Data Files and the pinned Unicode
  data. Never edit them by hand.
- `tests/`: C programs that use `talk.h` as a Host would.

`decimal`, `syntax`, `check`, `lower`, `machine`, `trace` and `corpus` join
`src/` in the later parts of step 1, and `session` and the REPL in step 6.

## Building and testing

Run these from `impl/zig/`, after `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and
`bun run unicode:check` at the repository root. The Unicode check downloads and
verifies the pinned UCD files the tests read.

```sh
zig build test                    # the Zig tests and the talk.h C tests
zig build                         # zig-out/lib/libtalk.a and zig-out/include/talk.h
zig build -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi    # zig-out/bin/talk.wasm
zig fmt --check .
```

Every build is `-Doptimize=safe` (ReleaseSafe) unless told otherwise, so bounds
and integer overflow stay checked while the Core reads hostile input.
`-Doptimize=fast` is refused.

The `wasm32-wasi` target builds a WASI reactor: a module with no `_start` that
exports `talk.h`'s functions. A Host instantiates it once per instance and calls
the exports directly.

From the repository root, `bun tools/zig/api.ts` compares `talk.h` with
`talk.go`. It fails on a `talk.h` name that `talk.go` doesn't declare, unless
the declaration is marked `C only`, and lists the `talk.go` names `talk.h`
doesn't declare yet. Those fail only from step 6's conformance gate.

## Regenerating tables

[`tools/zig/generate.ts`](../../tools/zig/generate.ts) writes the catalogues
and compiled Cost Model terms from `spec/data/*.toml`, and
[`tools/unicode/generate.ts`](../../tools/unicode/generate.ts) writes
`unicode.zig` and its `UNICODE-LICENSE.txt` from the pinned UCD. Neither reads
another Core.

```sh
bun run zig:generate        # the catalogues
bun run unicode:generate    # the Unicode table, for every Core
```

`bun run check` holds both to their sources and fails on a stale table. The
emitters write `zig fmt`'s canonical form themselves, so the check needs no Zig
toolchain; CI's `zig fmt --check` holds them to it.
